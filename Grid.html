<p>The universal wheel is a 360-degree rotating movement, which is easier and more convenient to pull up on a flat road surface(round shape) It can be pushed sideways when passing through an airport or a relatively narrow place at a station.

<p>The zipper will not be opened after it is firmly closed, but it is likely to be broken when loading too much stuff

<p>Compared with buckle zipper, it has certain elasticity. When there are many things, it can even be squeezed in.</p>

<p>Luggage levers use inline compression to reduce the height of the stretcher. You can pull the levers up.

                 <span>Briggs & Rileyhas just introduced a collection that is perfect for travelers who always need a little more room in their suitcase. The new Baseline CX styles allow for up to 34% more packing capacity.

Using compression technology (as opposed to the more common zipper expansion), travelers can expand the luggage without altering its original size. This solves the problem of travelers who tend to over-stuff their carry-ons, only to worry later on if the bag will fit in the overhead bin.

While packing, you expand the interior of the bag by pulling up the handles on each side. Load up the bag with all your stuff, and once it's closed, you just push it down and the bag compresses.

If you're planning to go on a long trip and need to pack more than your carry-on can handle, you can take along the checkable Baseline CX. The medium expandable Spinner is just 24 inches high, so it will not take so much space in a small hotel room.</span>
